_Husky A-1B N900HY_

Husky is a two-seat, high-wing, utility light aircraft built by Aviat Aircraft of Afton, Wyoming. It is a direct descendant of the Piper PA-18 Super Cub, the Husky has been in production since 1987. The aircraft is capable of operating from wheels, skis or floats.

The aircraft is outfitted with a NADIR aerial imaging camera and a gimbaled video camera attached via a cargo pod. 

We have partnered with [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) to provide aerial imagery for their disaster response efforts. The Husky is used to capture high resolution imagery of disaster affected areas to help with mapping and response efforts.

N900HY serves as our base platform for collecting aerial imaging data. It also serves as a great VFR and IFR training aircraft for our Humanitarian Air Response Team pilots.
